# CubeTimer
personal cube timer project, using bare-metal programming on the Arduino Uno Rev3
files in programs are a mixture of the actual project files and some random ones I use for testing

leftover lcd test files, going from lcd to segmented display and back

will actually add schematics and stuff once I finish this

working on making it handless using ultrasonic sensors
